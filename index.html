    <h2>All About Chapo</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Chapo, the world's greatest cat.</p>
    
    <p>I was born in May 2018. For the first couple months of my life, I was on the streets.
       One day in September, I was found by a human and brought inside.
       I lived with a lot of other cats. I got a bath, and learned how to use a litterbox.
       And in October 2018, I met my mama!</p>
    
    <p>Now I'm a house cat.
       It's pretty great. My mama loves me very much.
       I like to sleep by her head at night.
       She feeds me yummy food, and sometimes even treats!
       She lets me play with all kinds of stuff.
       There are even windows in the house that I can look out of!</p>
    
    <p>My mama always calls me handsome.
       I am mostly white, with some grey on my head and a striped grey tail.
       I like to meow at my favorite humans and sometimes they even meow back!
       I like to show my love by head butting and rubbing my face on humans.
       I love cuddles, and getting my belly rubbed!</p>
